msgid "pgRouting 2.0 release has total restructured the function naming and obsoleted many of the functions that were available in the 1.x releases. While we realize that this may inconvenience our existing users, we felt this was needed for the long term viability of the project to be more response to our users and to be able to add new functionality and test existing functionality."

msgid "We have made a minimal effort to save most of these function and distribute with the release in a file ``pgrouting_legacy.sql`` that is not part of the pgrouting extension and is not supported. If you can use these functions that is great. We have not tested any of these functions so if you find issues and want to post a pull request or a patch to help other users that is fine, but it is likely this file will be removed in a future release and we strongly recommend that you convert your existing code to use the new documented and supported functions."
