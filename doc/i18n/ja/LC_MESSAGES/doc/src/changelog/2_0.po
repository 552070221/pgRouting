"With the release of pgRouting 2.0 the library has abandoned backwards "
"compatibility to :ref:`pgRouting 1.x <changelog_1_x>` releases. We did this "
"so we could restructure pgRouting, standardize the function naming, and "
"prepare the project for future development. As a result of this effort, we "
"have been able to simplify pgRouting, add significant new functionality, "
"integrate documentation and testing into the source tree and make it easier "
"for multiple developers to make contribution."
