Adding an additional column to store if its part of the contracted graph
Adding a new edge joining vertices 3 and 5 with cost=2 to the edge table
Adding a new edge joining vertices 3 and 9 with cost=2 to the edge table
Adding a new edge joining vertices 5 and 11 with cost=2 to the edge table
Adding a new edge joining vertices 9 and 11 with cost=2 to the edge table
Case 1: Both source and target belong to the contracted graph.
We are going to route from 3 to 11
Since 3 and 11 both are in the contracted graph we need not add any vertices.

2|2|6|11|1|1
3|3|11|-1|0|2
Case 2: source belongs to a contracted graph, while target belongs to a vertex subgraph.
We are going to route from 3 to 7
Since 7 is in the contracted subgraph of vertex 5 we add {7, 8} to the vertex set, so the vertex set becomes (3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 17)
1|1|3|19|2|0

4|4|7|-1|0|4
Case 3: source belongs to a contracted graph, while target belongs to a edge subgraph.
We are going to route from 3 to 13
Since 13 is in the contracted subgraph of edge (5, 11) we add {10, 13} to the vertex set, so the vertex set becomes (3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17)

Case 4: source belongs to a vertex subgraph, while target belongs to a edge subgraph.
We are going to route from 7 to 13
Since 13 is in the contracted subgraph of edge (5, 11) we add {10, 13} to the vertex set, and since 7 is in the contracted subgraph of vertex 5 we add {7, 8} to the vertex sets (3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 17)

Case 5: The path contains a shortcut.

We are going to route from 3 to 9
Since 3 and 9 both are in the contracted graph we need not add any vertices.
1|1|3|20|2|0
2|2|9|-1|0|2
19|3|5|2|2|t
20|3|9|2|2|t
21|5|11|2|2|t
22|9|11|2|2|t
This implies that it is a shortcut and should be expanded

3|3|9|-1|0|2
