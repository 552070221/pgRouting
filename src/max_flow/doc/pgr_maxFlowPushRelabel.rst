   Boost Graph Inside


Synopsis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculates the maximum flow in a directed graph from a source node to a sink node.
Edges must be weighted with non-negative capacities.

Characteristics:
----------------

The main characterics are:
  - Process is done only on edges with positive capacities.
  - When the maximum flow is 0 then there is no flow and **EMPTY SET** is returned.

    - There is no flow when a **source** is the same as a **target**.

  - Any duplicated value in the source(s) or target(s) are ignored.
  - Calculates the flow/residual capacity for each edge. In the output, edges with zero flow are omitted.
  - Creates a **super source** and edges to all the source(s), and a **super target** and the edges from all the targets(s).
  - The maximum flow through the graph can be calculated by aggregation on source/sink which is garanteed to be the value returned by :ref:`pgr_maxFlow <pgr_maxFlow>` when executed with the same parameters.
  - Running time: :math:`O( V ^ 3)`
