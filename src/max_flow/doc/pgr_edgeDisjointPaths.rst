   Boost Graph Inside



Synopsis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Calculates the edge disjoint paths between two groups of vertices.
Utilizes underlying maximum flow algorithms to calculate the paths.

Characteristics:
----------------

The main characterics are:
  - Calculates the edge disjoint paths between any two groups of vertices.
  - Returns EMPTY SET when source and destination are the same, or cannot be reached.
  - The graph can be directed or undirected.
  - One to many, many to one, many to many versions are also supported.
  - Uses :ref:`pgr_maxFlowBoykovKolmogorov` to calculate the paths.
  - No `cost` or `aggregate cost` of the paths are returned. (Under discussion)
