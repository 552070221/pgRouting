pgr_dijkstra - Shortest Path Dijkstra
===============================================================================

``pgr_dijkstra`` â€” Returns the shortest path(s) using Dijkstra algorithm.
In particular, the Dijkstra algorithm implemented by Boost.Graph.

Synopsis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dijkstra's algorithm, conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1956.
It is a graph search algorithm that solves the shortest path problem for
a graph with non-negative edge path costs, producing a shortest path from 
a starting vertex (``start_vid``) to an ending vertex (``end_vid``).
This implementation can be used with a directed graph and an undirected graph.

Signatures
===============================================================================



.. index:: 
	single: dijkstra(edges_sql, start_vids_sql, end_vid, directed)

.. rubric:: Dijkstra many to 1:

.. code-block:: sql

      pgr_dijkstra(TEXT edges_sql, TEXT start_vids_sql, BIGINT end_vid,
			 BOOLEAN directed:=true);
	 RETURNS SET OF (seq, path_seq, start_vid, node, edge, cost, agg_cost) or EMPTY SET

This signature performs a Dijkstra from each ``start_vid`` in  ``start_vids_sql`` to one ``end_vid``:
  -  on a **directed** graph when ``directed`` flag is missing or is set to ``true``.
  -  on an **undirected** graph when ``directed`` flag is set to ``false``.

Using this signature, will load once the graph and perform several one to one Dijkstra
where the ending vertex is fixed.
The result is the union of the results of the one to one dijkstra.

The extra ``start_vid`` in the result is used to distinguish to which path it belongs.

For example:

.. literalinclude:: ../test/doc_dijkstra_sql_version.doc.result
   :start-after: -- q2
   :end-before: -- q3





.. index:: 
	single: dijkstra(edges_sql, start_vid, end_vids_sql, directed)

.. rubric:: Dijkstra 1 to many:

.. code-block:: sql

       pgr_dijkstra(TEXT edges_sql, BIGINT start_vid, TEXT end_vids_sql,
			 BOOLEAN directed:=true);
	 RETURNS SET OF (seq, path_seq, end_vid, node, edge, cost, agg_cost) or EMPTY SET

This signature performs a Dijkstra from one ``start_vid`` to each ``end_vid`` in ``end_vids_sql``:
  -  on a **directed** graph when ``directed`` flag is missing or is set to ``true``.
  -  on an **undirected** graph when ``directed`` flag is set to ``false``.

Using this signature, will load once the graph and perform several 1 to 1 Dijkstra
where the starting vertex is fixed.
The result is the union of the results of the one to one dijkstra.

The extra ``end_vid`` in the result is used to distinguish to which path it belongs.

For example:

.. literalinclude:: ../test/doc_dijkstra_sql_version.doc.result
   :start-after: -- q1
   :end-before: -- q2


.. index:: 
	single: dijkstra(edges_sql, start_vids_sql, end_vids_sql, directed)

.. rubric:: Dijkstra many to many:

.. code-block:: sql

       pgr_dijkstra(TEXT edges_sql, TEXT start_vids_sql, TEXT end_vids_sql,
			 BOOLEAN directed:=true);
	 RETURNS SET OF (seq, path_seq, start_vid, end_vid, node, edge, cost, agg_cost) or EMPTY SET

This signature performs a Dijkstra from each ``start_vid`` in  ``start_vids_sql`` to each ``end_vid`` in ``end_vids_sql``:
  -  on a **directed** graph when ``directed`` flag is missing or is set to ``true``.
  -  on an **undirected** graph when ``directed`` flag is set to ``false``.


Using this signature, will load once the graph and perform all combinations 
for starting vertices and ending vertices.

The extra ``start_vid`` and ``end_vid`` in the result is used to distinguish to which path it belongs.

For example:

.. literalinclude:: ../test/doc_dijkstra_sql_version.doc.result
   :start-after: -- q3



Description of the Signatures
=============================

Description of the edges_sql query
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:edges_sql: an SQL query, which should return a set of rows with the following columns:


============== ================= ======================
COLUMN         TYPE              DESCRIPTION
============== ================= ======================
:id:           ``ANY-INTEGER``   identifier of the edge.
:source:       ``ANY-INTEGER``   identifier of the first end point vertex of the edge.
:target:       ``ANY-INTEGER``   identifier of the second end pont vertex of the edge.
:cost:         ``ANY-NUMERICAL`` weight of the edge `(source, target)`, if negative: edge `(source, target)` does not exist, therefore it's not part of the graph.
:reverse_cost: ``ANY-NUMERICAL`` (optional) weight of the edge `(target, source)`, if negative: edge `(target, source)` does not exist, therefore it's not part of the graph.
============== ================= ======================

Where:

:ANY-INTEGER: SMALLINT, INTEGER, BIGINT
:ANY-NUMERICAL: SMALLINT, INTEGER, BIGINT, real, float

Description of the start_vids_sql and end_vids_sql  query
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:start_vids_sql: is an SQL query.
:end_vids_sql: is an SQL query. 
               
Both should return a set of rows with the following column:

============== ================= ======================
COLUMN         TYPE              DESCRIPTION
============== ================= ======================
:first_column: ``ANY-INTEGER``   identifier of a vertex. 
============== ================= ======================

Where:

:ANY-INTEGER: SMALLINT, INTEGER, BIGINT

:start_vids_sql: ``TEXT``    SQL query as described above.
:directed:       ``BOOLEAN`` (optional). When ``false`` the graph is considered as Undirected. Default is ``true`` which considers the graph as Directed.
