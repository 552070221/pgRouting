 pdp.cpp --> Main solver
 pdp.h  ---> Structures defined in this header file
 Solution.h -----> It contains the Solution Class and Code related to Neighborhoods
 Route.h   -----> Explains all about Route Class.
 pdp.c ---> Contains all the details on pgRouting integration.

 The main problem is in two steps. 1.)Getting the initial solutiion and 2.)Optimizing it.

 1.) "Initial solution":
 A few heuristics are applied to find a feasible initial solution. Sequential Construction and Hill climbing. More implementation details are found here:: https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/wiki/VRP-Pickup-Delivery-Problem

 2.) "Optimizing the Solution":
 A reactive tabu search is applied on the initial solution to get a feasible optimized solution. TabuSearch comes under local search methods. We have three neighborhoods
            i) Single Paired Insertion
            ii) Swapping pairs between routes
            iii)Within Route Insertion.
            Tabu attributes plays an important role in giving the best solution(it includes TabuLength, A vector containing feasible solutions and a counter for number of solutions).
            Reactive part discussed in the paper is to modify TabuLength based on the solution cycle.
