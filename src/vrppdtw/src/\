 typedef struct result {
         int seq;
         int rid;
         int nid;
         float8 cost;
 } RESULT;


Clean output in the following format

seq 1...*
rid would repeat for each node in the route
nid would be the list of nodes in the route
cost to get to that node
so
1,21,3,c
2,21,5,c+
3,21,6,c++
4,21,3,c+++
5,22,7,c
etc
so 1-4 are the first route with rid=21
the route 3,5,6,3
I assumed that the depot was 3
but the first and last node of the route should be the depot
the cost increments we each node
and the total cost is when I get back to the depot
then start the next route
etc




start with a route, complete all customers   seq, rid, nid, cost  
              we can update cost later
