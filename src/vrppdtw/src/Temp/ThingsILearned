            Q.)  Why do we put a conditional in header file ?
   Reason: If a header file happened to be included twice, the preprocessor will read it twice and throw an error. The standard way to prevent this is to put a conditional.
   Sample:  #ifndef HEADER_FILE
            #define HEADER_FILE

                Content is here 

            #endif
