  - Dead end contraction:
Vertex 1 is contracted to Vertex 2:
0{ id: 1,         contracted vertices: {}}
1{ id: 2,         contracted vertices: {0, }}
  - Linear contraction:
Vertex 1 is contracted to edge -1:
1{id: 2,      contracted vertices: {}}
{id: -1,      source: 3,      target: 5,      cost: 0,      contracted vertices: {0, 1, }}
