1..29
ok 1 - From 2 to 3 returns the same result as pgr_dijkstra(one to many)
ok 2 - Gives a record when no path is found from v to v
ok 3 - It is the union
ok 4 - Gives a record when no path is found from u to v
ok 5 - Not documented: When a target is not found there is no path, So returns -1 in cost
ok 6 - Several targets are the same: returns all values
ok 7 - None of the target vertices has been found; all costs must have a -1 (except for v,v)
ok 8 - Start vertex does not exist in the edges: all cost must have a -1
ok 9 - threw XX000
ok 10 - 10: Throws when source is not int
ok 11 - 11: Throws when target is not int
ok 12 - 12: Throws when cost is not float
ok 13 - threw XX000
ok 14 - 14: Throws because an array was not given
ok 15 - 15: Throws because a NOT int was was given as starting vertex
ok 16 - 16: Throws because the array has data that is not integer
ok 17 - threw XX000
ok 18 - threw XX000
ok 19 - threw XX000
ok 20 - threw XX000
ok 21 - threw XX000
ok 22 - 22: Throws because the arrays are of big int
ok 23 - 23: Throws because unsalvable contradiction: https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/blob/master/src/kdijkstra/src/k_targets_sp.c#L237
ok 24 - 24: Does not throw when salvable contradiction
ok 25 - threw XX000
ok 26 - threw XX000
ok 27 - threw XX000
ok 28 - threw XX000
ok 29 - threw XX000
