1..29
ok 1 - From 2 to 3 returns the same result as pgr_dijkstra(one to many)
ok 2 - Gives a record when no path is found from v to v
ok 3 - It is the union
ok 4 - Gives a record when no path is found from u to v
ok 5 - Only ONE target is found: Code link: https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/blob/master/src/kdijkstra/src/k_targets_sp.c#L790
ok 6 - Several targets are the same: Code link: https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/blob/master/src/kdijkstra/src/k_targets_sp.c#L790
ok 7 - None of the targets are found Code link: https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/blob/master/src/kdijkstra/src/k_targets_sp.c#L794
ok 8 - Start vertex does exist in the edges: Code Link: https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/blob/master/src/kdijkstra/src/k_targets_sp.c#L784
ok 9 - id is not int
ok 10 - source is int
ok 11 - target is int
ok 12 - cost is float
ok 13 - reverse_cost is float
ok 14 - Throws because an array was not given
ok 15 - Throws because a NOT int was was given as starting vertex
ok 16 - Throws because the array has data that is integer
ok 17 - Throws because its not a 1 dimention array: https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/blob/master/src/kdijkstra/src/k_targets_sp.c#L131
ok 18 - Throws because its missing id: https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/blob/master/src/kdijkstra/src/k_targets_sp.c#L214
ok 19 - Throws because its missing source: https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/blob/master/src/kdijkstra/src/k_targets_sp.c#L214
ok 20 - Throws because its missing target: https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/blob/master/src/kdijkstra/src/k_targets_sp.c#L214
ok 21 - Throws because its missing cost: https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/blob/master/src/kdijkstra/src/k_targets_sp.c#L214
ok 22 - Throws because the arrays are of big int
ok 23 - Throws because unsalvable contradiction: https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/blob/master/src/kdijkstra/src/k_targets_sp.c#L237
ok 24 - Does throw when salvable contradiction
ok 25 - Throws because source has a null: https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/blob/master/src/kdijkstra/src/k_targets_sp.c#L267
ok 26 - Throws because id has a null: https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/blob/master/src/kdijkstra/src/k_targets_sp.c#L267
ok 27 - Throws because target has a null: https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/blob/master/src/kdijkstra/src/k_targets_sp.c#L272
ok 28 - Throws because cost has a null: https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/blob/master/src/kdijkstra/src/k_targets_sp.c#L277
ok 29 - Throws because reverse_cost has a null: https://github.com/pgRouting/pgrouting/blob/master/src/kdijkstra/src/k_targets_sp.c#L285
