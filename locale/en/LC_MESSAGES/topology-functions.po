"The pgRouting's topology of a network, represented with an edge table "
"with source and target attributes and a vertices table associated with "
"it. Depending on the algorithm, you can create a topology or just "
"reconstruct the vertices table, You can analyze the topology, We also "
"provide a function to node an unoded network."
