## INTRODUCTION

pgRouting extends the PostGIS/PostgreSQL geospatial database to provide geospatial routing and other network analysis functionality.

This library contains following features:

* All Pairs Shortest Path, Johnsonâ€™s Algorithm
* All Pairs Shortest Path, Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
* Shortest Path A*
* Bi-directional Dijkstra Shortest Path
* Bi-directional A* Shortest Path
* Shortest Path Dijkstra
* Driving Distance
* K-Shortest Path, Multiple Alternative Paths
* K-Dijkstra, One to Many Shortest Path
* Traveling Sales Person
* Turn Restriction Shortest Path (TRSP)


## REQUIREMENTS

=======
# OSMContraction

OSMContraction is a cpp library which compresses OSM graph data and makes routing faster.

### Version
0.0.0

### Technologies Used

OSMContraction uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* Boost Graph libraries - CPP libraries for graphs.
* PostgreSQL - A relational database query language
* Postgis - A plugin for Postgresql.
* Osm2pgrouting - A tool which converts osm data into a postgres schema.

### Requirements
>>>>>>> aea359f36032a4fb2841d4d6abdc5d0886759c39
* C and C++ compilers
* Postgresql version >= 9.1
* PostGIS version >= 2.0
* The Boost Graph Library (BGL).

## INSTALLATION

See online documentation: http://docs.pgrouting.org/

## COMPILATION

For MinGW on Windows

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -G"MSYS Makefiles" ..
	make
	make install

Also pre-built Windows binaries can be downloaded from http://.postgis.net/windows_downloads

For Linux
	
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake  ..
	make
	sudo make install

Build with documentation (requires [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/))

	cmake -DWITH_DOC=ON ..

Postgresql 9.1+

	createdb mydatabase
	psql mydatabase -c "create extension postgis"
	psql mydatabase -c "create extension pgrouting"

## USAGE

See online documentation: http://docs.pgrouting.org/dev/doc/index.html


## LICENSE

* Most features are available under GPLv2.
* Some Boost extensions are available under Boost license (see LICENSE_1_0.txt)
* Some code contributed by iMaptools.com is available under MIT-X license.
=======
### Installation

Install the above requirements



```sh
$ git clone [git-repo-url] directory_path
$ cd directory
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install
```
### Usage

This query gives the shortest path between two vertices in the OSM data.

```sh
$ psql > select my_dijkstra('SELECT * from ways',start_vid,end_vid);
```

### Todos

 - Write Graph Contraction class in cpp
 - Writing a postgres query which contracts the graph
 - Testing the query for different cases


### Testing

 - The functionality of Graph contraction class is defined in graphMinimizer.hpp
 - Its functionality can be tested using the test.cpp file.
